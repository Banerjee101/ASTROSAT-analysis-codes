# ASTROSAT-analysis-codes
These are my codes to analyse LAXPC PCA and SXT data to extract the light curves, power spectra, color color diagram, energy spectra (which would take in the level 2 data files and fit it with any additive models mentioned in an ascii file). Mind you this is an ongoing project (which contains custom repositories, codes written in shell, python and IDL) and hence will have several alterations to it in the future.
