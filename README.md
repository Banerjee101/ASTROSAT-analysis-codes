# ASTROSAT-analysis-codes
These are my codes to analyse LAXPC PCA and SXT data to extract the light curves, power spectra, color color diagram and energy spectra (The model fitting code for LAXPC and SXT are a part of another project). Mind you this is an ongoing project (which contains custom repositories, codes written in shell, python and IDL) and hence will have several alterations to it in the future. 
Please note that there is no particular structure to the documents as of now, since I am using this as a dump for my project codes.
